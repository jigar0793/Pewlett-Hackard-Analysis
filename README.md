# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to conduct a Database analysis for Pewlett Hackard with detailed information on the number of future retirees from all departments currently working at the company to be able to prepare a plan to hire new staff and also to prepare a mentorship initiative. 

The criterion was based on the birth dates ranging from 1952 to 1955 and hired dates from 1985 to 1988.

## Results

Below is the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) used to visualize the relationship between the data sources and the structure of the company's employee plan to facilitate the analysis.

### Retirements table

From the table of retirees and which titles they will leave vacant, we can see that close to 70,000 posts will be left vacant at the company as shown in the image below:

A lot of senior positions are going to be vacant after the retirements. Especially many 'Senior Engineer' and 'Senior Staff' positions will be required to be filled.

### Mentorship Candidates

Below is the list of candidates that can qualify to become members of the mentorship program, they can be referenced as "senior" employees amongst the general staff.

The table contains the current title information for all of the employees determined to be eligible for the mentorship program. This will allow the company to figure out how to distribute their resources once the retirements happen.

## Summary

At the moment at Pewlett Hackard, 70,000 of their employees are getting ready for retirement or being redirected to their mentorship initiatives, which will mean that they are likely going to need an extensive hiring process in the upcoming years. To study that we can look at how many roles will be left vacant per department. The following image has the information we need:

 Since a significant amount of future retirees hold Senior positions the mentorship program should provide a capacitation buffer for the extensive expertise that will be leaving the company in the years to come. A table detailing all the retirement-ready employees who could be eligible to take up mentorship roles are shown in the image below:
